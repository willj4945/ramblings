# Ramblings

> Notes, ideas, and experiments — a place to ramble about what I’m building and learning.

Welcome to **Ramblings**, my personal blog and digital notebook.  
Here, I share thoughts on technology, coding, design, privacy, and whatever else I happen to be exploring.  
It’s a mix of in-progress experiments, reflections, and small write-ups about what I’m learning along the way.
