# 👋 About Me

Hey there — I’m **Will Johnson**, a Security Engineer currently working in **DevSecOps**.  
I focus on **security automation within GitLab**, moving compliance away from paper, and doing everything **as code**.

Python is my favorite language — I use it every day to build tools, automate workflows, and experiment with new ideas.  
When I’m not coding, I like to tinker with PowerShell scripts, explore privacy tools, and learn about security at a low level.

## 💭 About *Ramblings*

**Ramblings** is my personal lab notebook — a place to share ideas, unfinished projects,  
and insights from what I’m building or learning.  

It started as a way to track my own learning journey,  
but if someone else finds a snippet of code or an idea here useful — even better.

> “Write things down. Half the time, you’re writing for your future self.”
